  ## Description 
  Rock, Paper, Scissors is a hand game originating from China, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. I built a program from scratch that wil allow a user to play the game from the browser.
  
  ## Installation 
  No installation instructions.

  ## Usage 
  The user must have access to the internet and a browser in order to play the game. Click on the word Play next to the game controller icon under project title to indulge and let me know your thoughts! :)
